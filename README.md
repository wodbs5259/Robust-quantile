# Skipped-Quantile

This repository contains codes necessary to replicate **Joo and Lee**: "Accurate quantile estimation via clipped check loss minimization". The `fit.rob` function in the `code` folder

1. Thesis title
   - Accurate quantile estimation via clipped check loss minimization
  
2. Our goal
   - We propose accurate quantile estimation method
   - Our method include bounded loss function that is more robust method.
  
3. File construct
   - src/ : Function of proposed method code and simulation code
   - data/ : Real data
